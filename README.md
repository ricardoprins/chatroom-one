# Chatroom One

<a href="https://www.gitter.com/ricardoprins/community"><img alt="gitter logo" src="https://img.shields.io/gitter/room/ricardoprins/community"></a>

A sample implementation of a chat room, using FastAPI and MongoDB.

I will do it in a step-by-step process - I will try a new method here that I've learned from an online course I took on Vue3 - I'll build a different branch for each step of the process.

The kickstart will be a single page, no CSS, no format, no anything .html page, using FastAPI + Websockets to send and store messages to a browser. Since FastAPI inherits from Starlette, it also supports using Websockets (I'll use it more extensively later).

### Requirements

Please check _requirements.txt_ for the dependencies - I'll be adding to it progressively until the end result. Also, if you have any additional suggestions of different libraries that are unknown to me, please feel free to make your suggestion here.

### Branches

- master: when I finish, it will contain the main version - for now, as the description mentions, it just contains a very basic version
- adding-complexity: few improvements to CSS (not complete yet!)
